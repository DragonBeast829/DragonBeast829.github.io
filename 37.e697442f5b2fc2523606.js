The characters personality only comes from the Lord's description (Although if you have played a D&D Campaign, then you may possibly know more about the Lords.) The gameplay of Lords of Waterdeep is that at the beginning of the game, everyone is brought a Lord card. No-one knows who eachother is. Your Lord card will say what quests you will get more Victory Points from. Quests appear on the board, and players can visit the Cliffwatch Inn to take a Quest Card. To finish the Quest and get Victory Points, you will need to build up Adventurers and Gold by going to Adventurer locations on the board, as well as Gold locations, or by using specific Intrigue Cards. Only ONE player can be on a location at a time, unless an Intrigue or Building says otherwise. Intrigue Cards come in handy, as when you use one, you get a special buff. like a certain amount of Gold, some Adventurers, or maybe even an Attack to the other players \ud83d\udc40. You can only play Intrigue cards at the Waterdeep Harbor, though. With gold, you can purchase Buildings at the Builder's Hall, which will add in a new location to the board that you control. Each players take turns, going clockwise from the player who goes first. Each player gets 4 Agents, who can go to locations on the board. The rounds end when all agents are used. On Round 5, all players get a 5th Agent to use. After the 8th and final round, scoring is done, and whoever has the most Victory Points at the end wins.
