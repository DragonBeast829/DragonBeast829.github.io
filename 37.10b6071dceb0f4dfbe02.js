In Betrayal at House on the Hill, you and a group of other people explore a haunted house together. However, one of you might be a traitor plotting to kill the others.

The characters dont really have personalities, other than what the player playing as them gives them. The gameplay of Betrayal at House on the Hill plays as follows: Each player can find items (They can be weapons or other things), events can happen (a crazy guy might start following you around or ghosts might write something on a mirror), and you can find omens which are basically events or items, except you roll some dice for a "haunt roll" to determine whether the "haunt" starts. The haunt is where people can begin to attack others, and somebody might become a traitor with evil goals.
