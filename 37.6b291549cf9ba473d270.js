Boss Monster is a card game about being a Boss in a fantasy world and building up a dungeon to kill the heroes.

Boss Monster doesn't necessarily have a story, other than that you are a villain in a video-game like world and you must kll all the heroes that enter your dungeon. You play Boss Monster by first getting your Boss card. Everybody knows who eachother is, unlike Lords of Waterdeep. At the beginning of the game, each player is given a few rooms and spells. You build the first room of the dungeon, revealing the rooms in order from most Boss Experience, to least Boss Experience. Then, the heroes come to the village. If your playing with items, an item also comes to help the heroes. Then, we build again. Then heroes decide what dungeon they want to go to, then come (If they've decided.). After killing a hero, you get a soul. After being attacked by a hero, you get a blood. When you get 5 bloods, you die, and your out of the game. When you get 10 souls, you win the game. Then, you draw new room cards, and build. Then heroes come, then the heroes decide, and then they go off to adventure in the dungeons, and that process repeats.
