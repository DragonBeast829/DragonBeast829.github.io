Genius teenager Senku Ishigami wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world 3,700 years in the future where everybody has been turned to stone, and he has a fluid being created in a cave that can "resurrect" the petrified people. The artstyle of Dr. Stone has very well drawn backgrounds, and the artstyle of the characters differ, as the males have smaller eyes that are closer together than the females, who have bigger eyes and the eyes are farther apart on the face.

I believe that the art is very good, as explained before, the backgrounds are very well drawn. And, they drew the females and males as having different eyes, making it easier to distinguish genders (If some characters were hard to distinguish gender) Give general impression of how I think the story is good or bad. I believe that the story is also very well made and thought out. Though the concept of petrification healing the living being inside is kind of odd, the story is well-paced and easy to understand.
