        <h1>Bartholomew Bartholomore IV</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Bartholomew is everyone's favorite dude. He is a rainbow-ish colored octopus whose full name is Bartholomew Bartholomore IV. When Bartholomew IV was the monarch of <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/atlantis">Atlantis</a>, he was such a good king that scientists were researching how to clone Bartholomew IV. After many failed attempts (and creating an entirely new species known as the <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/bartholinian">Bartholinian</a>), the cloning succeeded and created a new king to rule after Bartholomew IV's untimely death. Bartholomew Bartholomore IV is still alive and well. His death was merely fabricated by the <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/bartholinian">Bartholinians</a>, as they wanted their own kind to be the ruling species.</p>
        <h2>Current State</h2>
        <p>Currently (as of 2023), Bartholomew resides in <a href="https://wikipedia.com/wiki/alaska">Alaska</a>, and is quite healthy.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Bartholomew was born in <a href="https://wikipedia.com/wiki/poland">Poland</a>, however human children tormented him so much that he moved to Atlantis, where he cooked and sold pierogis for a living. Eventually, he discovered his true meaning in life when a royal scientist named <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/squidward">Squidward</a> sent him a letter informing him that he contains more royal blood than the current king of <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/atlantis">Atlantis</a>, meaning Bartholomew was the true king.</p>
