        <h1>Peepur Rat Clan</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Peepur Rat Clan originated from the <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/atlantis">Rattus</a> population of <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/atlantis">Atlantis</a>. When Bartholomew V (Clone of Bartholomew IV) took over as king of <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/atlantis">Atlantis</a>, he attempted to execute all <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/atlantis">Ratti</a>, in an effort to make all living Atlantians <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/bartholinian">Bartholinians</a>. The remaining few Ratti (approx. 3) emigrated from <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/atlantis">Atlantis</a> to found their own country, the Peepur Rat Clan. Years later, with a strong army, they set out to gather <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/radioactive-honey">Radioactive Honey</a> to dip their soldiers in. This began the <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/great-honey-war">Great Honey War</a> that lasted for many years. By the end of the war, they had gathered enough <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/radioactive-honey">Radioactive Honey</a> to create a new, far stronger army. They dipped their soldiers into the <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/radioactive-honey">Radioactive Honey</a> to create <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/peepur-honey-rat">Peepur Honey Rat</a>, their ultimate warrior. As fast as sound, and as strong as a strongman, the <a href="tristan.rf.gd/bartholomew-wiki/peepur-honey-rat">Peepur Honey Rat</a> is a formidable foe.</p>
