Quaver has 2 modes: Singleplayer and Multiplayer. In singleplayer, you play different songs by yourself with either 4 keys or 7 keys. In multiplayer, you play the game against other players. Anybody can create their own song. All they need is an MP3 file for the music, a background image, and general knowledge of how to map songs in Quaver. Quaver has a fairly minimalistic arstyle, however people who decide to mod Quaver can change the art of the notes, buttons and background. Quaver was released on July 10th, 2020 and as of writing this it is currently early access.
